You know how you sometimes see someone fumble really badly at something really easy and want to just make it, but better?
Well, this is me letting my inner demons out at this bozo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-U2st6-MZI) for making code that really sucked ass
At least, it sucked ass up to the point where I stopped watching and started poking around.
Anyways, jokes aside, this is just another intrusive (non-shower) shower thought project because it really did kinda suck.
